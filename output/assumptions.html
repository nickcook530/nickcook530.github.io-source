<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>I don't know you but I'm going to guess you're a smart person... I mean you're reading this blog so I can't be that wrong. One thing smart people do exceptionally well is solve problems. There is no feeling quite like finding the perfect solution to a difficult problem. In a lot of jobs your performance is based on solving problems. Solving problems is great! The issue comes when you start solving problems that aren't actually problems. Assuming something is a problem is a surefire way to spend time coming up with an excellent solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Time is in high demand and short supply in the software industry so we certainly can't be spending it on faux problems. </p>
<p>Making sure you and your team are solving actual problems is one of the most direct ways a Product Manager can impact the value being delivered to stakeholders. Sure you could probably prioritize what to work on better and you could possibly skip addressing some of the problems but let's crawl before we walk. At least we are working on real, customer problems!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>The first large project I worked on as a PM was transitioning our application to a modern user interface (UI) while selectively removing features and adding new ones along the way. The first piece of the new UI we built was the home screen. A totally reimagined home screen that provided the user a suite of widgets (tiles of information) which they could customize and layout on the screen however they chose.</p>
<p>We put a ton of hard work into the home screen, it looked amazing, and it was just about ready for its big debut... but there was one major problem. If a user shrunk their browser window the home screen layout would shift to accommodate the smaller screen, which was good, but when the user expanded their window again the layout would not shift back. The idea that customers would hate this didn't feel like an assumption, it felt obvious, so we set out to fix the problem. The developers researched multiple possible solutions, and attempted a few, but ultimately we couldn't find a satisfactory fix in time for the release. We had not been able to solve this serious problem and we were ready for the barrage of customer complaints.</p>
<p>In over a year since the first release of the home screen we received exactly one complaint about the shifting layout. One complaint certainly does not qualify as a "barrage" but it does qualify as a lesson learned. We assumed there was a problem that did not actually exist. But the problem seemed so obvious and real, so how do we make sure we are solving real problems?</p>
<p>Well I'm glad you asked! That seems like an excellent topic for my next post...</p>
