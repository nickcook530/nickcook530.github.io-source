<p><em>"If you're not embarrassed you've waited too long to release."</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong></p>
<p>Nobody likes being embarrassed. Nobody wants to open their project up to scrutiny when they know so many obvious flaws exist. It feels unnatural, which makes sense considering most of us spend the first 20ish years of our life in school, working tirelessly to perfect assignments before we hand them in for scrutiny and evaluation. Imagine how different it would be if you could hand in the assignment, get some feedback, rework it, hand it in again, get more feedback, rework it, etc. until you got that coveted 100%. Maybe my Fluid Dynamics grade wouldn't have been so bad... Anyways, while we didn't get that opportunity with our homework we do get it when developing software.</p>
<p>You may have heard of the term "minimum viable product" (MVP). It's a term most commonly used for winning arguments about feature inclusion. Just hit them with a "Yeah but is that really MVP?" and watch them shake. Everyone in the world seems to have their own definition of MVP so I'll refrain from adding another to the mix. I'm partial to the definition provided by Eric Ries of Lean Startup fame. Eric defined an MVP as "that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." As we discussed in the <a href="/assumptions">last post</a>, we want to avoid making assumptions, and instead let our customers tell us what needs to be improved. Our goal should be to do the least work possible to get a product (MVP) to our customers in order to start the learning process.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Experience:</strong></p>
<p>As I did in my last post, I will again use our new application home screen as an example. As we were planning out our new home screen, the first feature of the new application, we had to decide how many widgets (tiles of information) we were going to launch with so users could customize their home screen. We started with 17 planned widgets but being savvy PM's we knew about the whole "minimum viable product" thing so we cut it down to six widgets. Genius! Of course the widgets would be complete with search, sorting, filtering, dynamic sizing, and links to areas of the old application that weren't available in the new one, but those are essentials to the MVP... right?</p>
<p>The development teams worked incredibly hard over multiple months and we built the perfect home screen complete with six widgets, just like we planned! We publicized the release to our customer base, excitement built, we released, and customers logged in to our new application!...and then they stopped logging in. Why would they stop logging in? Were the widgets not awesome enough? We started talking to customers about the home screen and found out that it had nothing to do with the home screen itself, it's just that customers wanted to be able to complete their work in one interface, so until an entire user flow was available in the new application they preferred to just use the old application.</p>
<p>Turns out it didn't matter how many widgets there were or how many bells and whistles they had, that wasn't enough to get customers to keep coming back. Good thing we learned that before building the seventh widget, but it likely didn't need to take us six widgets with search, sorting and filtering to figure that out either. Maybe we could have released one simple widget and gotten that same feedback with a fraction of the work and then shifted our development efforts accordingly. Oh well, as they say "hindsight is 20/20", so we'll just have to chalk it up to another lesson learned and soldier on.</p>
<p>In the next post we will talk about MVP's less popular cousin, the "minimum lovable product"...and hopefully use a learning experience that doesn't make me look so bad...</p>
