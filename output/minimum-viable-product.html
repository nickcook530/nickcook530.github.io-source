<p><em>"If you're not embarrassed you've waited too long to release."</em></p>

<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong></p>
<p>Nobody likes being embarrassed. Nobody wants to open their project up to scrutiny when they know so many obvious flaws exist. It feels unnatural, which makes sense considering most of us spend the first 20ish years of our life in school, working tirelessly to perfect assignments before we hand them in for scrutiny and evaluation. Imagine how different it would be if you could hand in the assignment, get some feedback, rework it, hand it in again, get more feedback, rework it, etc. until you got a perfect score. Maybe my Fluid Dynamics grade wouldn't have been so bad... Anyways, while we didn't get that opportunity with our homework we do get it when developing software.</p>
<p>You may have heard of the term "minimum viable product" (MVP). It's a term most commonly used for winning arguments about feature inclusion. Just hit them with a "Yeah but is that really MVP?" and watch them shake. Everyone in the world seems to have their own definition of MVP so I'll refrain from adding another to the mix. I'm partial to the definition provided by Eric Ries of Lean Startup fame. Eric defined an MVP as "that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." As we discussed in the <a href="/assumptions">last post</a>, we want to avoid making assumptions, and instead let our customers tell us what needs to be improved. Our goal should be to do the least work possible to get a product (MVP) to our customers in order to start the learning process.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Experience:</strong></p>
<p>As I did in my last post, I will again use our new application home screen as an example. As we were planning out our new home screen, the first feature of the new application, we had to decide how many widgets (tiles of information) we were going to launch with so users could customize their home screen. We started with seventeen planned widgets but being savvy PM's we knew about the whole "minimum viable product" thing so we cut it down to 6 widgets. Genius! Of course the widgets would be complete with search, sorting, dynamic sizing, and links to areas of the old application that weren't available in the new one, but those are essentials to the MVP... right?</p>
<p>The development teams worked incredibly hard over multiple months and we delivered the perfect home screen and 6 widgets to our customers, just like we planned! We sent our release notes, held a webinar,tThe customers all logged in to our new application...and then they stopped logging in. Why would they stop logging in? The widgets were awesome! We started talking to customers about the home screen and found out that it had nothing to do with the home screen itself, it's just that customers wanted to be able to complete their work in one interface, so until an entire user flow was available in the new application they preferred to just use the old application.</p>
<p>Oh boy, did we feel foolish. It didn't need to take us 6 widgets with search and sorting to figure that out. We could have released 1 simple widget and gotten that same feedback with a fraction of the work and then shifted our development efforts accordingly. Well, chalk it up to another lesson learned!</p>
<p>In the next post we will talk about how I learned to take a "minimum viable product" to a "minimum lovable product"...and hopefully use a learning experience that doesn't make me look so bad...</p>
