*"Who is this guy and why should I read his blog?"*

Well, I don't have a strong argument for why you should read this blog but I can introduce myself. My name is Nicholas Cook, but please call me Nick, only my mom calls me Nicholas. I've been a Product Manager (PM) at a business-to-business (B2B) soft as a service (SaaS) company for just about two years at the time of writing this. Phew, glad we got all those acronyms out of the way.

Just to be totally clear upfront, I do not consider myself nearly experienced enough to be an authority on product management and that is certainly not the goal of this blog. Perhaps in 30 to 100 years from now when I finally got the hang of this PM thing I can write that definitive blog on product management. Until then I'll be working on this blog instead, in which I plan to document many of the lessons I've learned and experiences I've had on my way from being "not a PM" to "kinda a PM". Hopefully you can find something of value and, if you're new to being a PM, avoid the myriad of mistakes that I've made.

My goal is to keep the writing style conversational, the posts relatively short, and the content structure similar throughout. For any given topic I'll open with an easy to remember quote, a description of the lesson I learned, and a relevant example or two from my professional experience.That said, I'll treat this blog as I would any product or feature and as such I'm very open to changes based on your feedback!

With the formalities out of the way, lets get on to our [first topic...](/mvp)
