This page will be a constantly updated list of resources that I have found helpful in improving my product management skillset. Much like a good backlog, I will rank each resource so you can hopefully get the most value as quickly as possible.

## Product Management

### 1) [**Inspired**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35249663-inspired) by Marty Cagan

I imagine Marty pitching _Inspired_ to a friend looked something like this:  
"I want to write a book about product management."  
"That sounds great Marty, what part specifically?"  
"...All of it." 
    
_Inspired_ has an ambitious scope as it seemingly strives to touch on every important product management concept in an effort to give the reader a strong foundation. While the book can lack cohesion as it bounces from concept to concept that is perhaps a necessary evil to fit everything into a palatable page count. This book is my first recommendation to anyone looking to learn more about product management, not because I think it's perfect but because it helps teach you what you don't know. This book is not the ultimate source for anything but the jumping off point for many things.

### 2) [**The Lean Startup**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup?from_search=true&qid=1t78ttU3k0&rank=1) by Eric Ries

_The Lean Startup_ is gaining on _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ as the "book most likely to be randomly recommended to you at a random social gathering".
