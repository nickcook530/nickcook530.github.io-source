*"Assume makes an 'ass' of 'u' and 'me'."*

**Description:**
I don't know you but I'm going to guess you're a smart person... I mean you're reading this blog so I can't be that wrong. One thing smart people do exceptionally well is solve problems. There is no feeling quite like finding the perfect solution to a difficult problem. In a lot of jobs your performance is based on solving problems. Solving problems is great! The issue comes when you start solving problems that aren't actually problems. Assuming something is a problem is surefire way to spend time coming up with an excellent solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Time is in high demand and short supply in the software industry so we certainly can't be spending it on faux problems. 

Making sure you and your team are solving actual problems is one of the most direct ways a Product Manager can impact the value being delivered to stakeholders. Sure you could probably prioritize what to work on better and you could possibly skip addressing some of the problems but let's crawl before we walk. At least we are working on real, customer problems!

**Example:**
The first large project I worked on as a PM was transitioning our application to a modern user interface (UI) while selectively removing features and adding new ones along the way. The first piece of the new UI we built was the home screen. A totally reimagined home screen that provided the user a suite of widgets (tiles of information) which they could customize and layout on the screen however they chose.

We put a ton of hard work into this home screen and it was just about ready for its big debut, but there was one major problem.
